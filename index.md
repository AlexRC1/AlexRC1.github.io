### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 was one of if not my favorite lab during this semester. Even though it was our last, throughout the year we did not work on anything to do with animation. However, in Lab 12, both parts 1 and 2 guided us on how to make a functioning animated gradient utilizing a random number generator, seeds, etc. This was also the first time that I was able to create a random number generator which was very cool in my opinion!

* Lab 8

    Similar to Lab 12, Lab 8 was also a fun and interesting lab because it was relatively different and stood out to me more than other labs. In part 1, we made a code in which we would obtain the average scores of olympic judges. In part 2 of Lab 8, we were able to create a pattern using a variety of bars and dashes. This part of the lab particularly demonstrated how loops can be utilized to make creative patterns such as the two triangles that were made with the help of such loops. I enjoyed part 2 more than 1, but the lab I overall enjoyed because it was a change in what we normally did in our labs!

* Lab 1

    Of course, the most important lab of them all; Lab 1. Lab 1 was for sure one of the most important labs for me as a student in the class. Coming into this class I was unfamiliar with coding in general, seeing code for the first time on Ubuntu was definitely an eye opener as we navigated through the lab. I enjoyed this lab because it helped grow a passion of coding within me, introducing me to the C++ language which I thought was alien coming into this class. In Lab 1, we were introduced to a Hello World code, in which our names would show as "Hello Alex!". This lab was simply helping us to execute a simple but effective code, and I really enjoyed it at the beginning of the year!
